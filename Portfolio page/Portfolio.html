            <h1>Hello and welcome to my portfolio</h1>
            <p class = "informationParagraph">Most of my projects are located on my <a href="https://github.com/PeterGion?tab=repositories">GitHub page</a>. Currently I don't have too many projects
                on there because I just started using it recently however,
                I will be trying to update it with some of my older projects. Still if you would like to look at them, I suggest you do that. 
            <section>
                <H2 class="sectionHeader">Car Parking appliction</H2>
                <p class = "informationParagraph">However, there is one of the projects that I'm most proud of that I would like to go over in particular, that would be my <a href="https://github.com/PeterGion/CarParkingProject">car parking application</a>.</p></p>
                <p class = "informationParagraph">
                    I worked hard on that app, and I think that the functionality of it is quite good. 
                    What it does is it is a proof-of-concept app that is supposed to show you the open parking spaces at eastern.
                </p class = "informationParagraph">    
                <p class = "informationParagraph">Upon first loading the app you are greeted with this screen</p>
                <img class = "firstpicture picture" src = "../pictures/portflolio/first screen shot.png">
                <p class = "informationParagraph belowImage">Then you can click on the more option buttons in the top right</p>
                <img class = "firstpicture picture" src = "../pictures/portflolio/second screen shot.png">
                <p class = "informationParagraph belowImage">From this menu you will be able to select either garage</p>
                <p class = "informationParagraph ">Upon selecting a garage, you will be greeted with a map of that garage</p>
                <img class = "firstpicture picture" src = "../pictures/portflolio/third screenshot.png">
                <p class = "informationParagraph belowImage">As you can imagine the red spot means that the spot is taken and the green means that the spot is open.
                    You can also swipe left or right to go to the next floor or previous floor respectively.</p>
                <p class = "informationParagraph">Then the other option that you can select from the first menu is the settings</p>     
                <img class = "firstpicture picture" src = "../pictures/portflolio/fourth screen shot.png">
                <p class = "informationParagraph belowImage">From here you can choose two options “pick up where I left off” or “open my favorite garage” this is quite self-explanatory.</p>  
                <p class = "informationParagraph">That is my app it doesn't seem like much but developing every
                    little thing takes a really long time and you can see all of the code on my <a href="https://github.com/PeterGion/CarParkingProject">GitHub page</a> if you don't believe me.</p>

            <section>
                <H2 class="sectionHeader">Wordle</H2>
                <p class = "informationParagraph">Another project that I would like to highlight would be my version of <a href="../Portfolio page/wordle.html">wordle</a> that I made. I saw the popularity of wordle, and I decided to take a shot at making my own version of it.</p>
                <p class = "informationParagraph">Currently its quite bare bones and more of a proof of concept than an actual game but it does work. There is only one word that you must try to guess but other than that its pretty much the same as the regular wordle.</p>
                <p class = "informationParagraph"> *As a side note the source code for wordle is also available on my Git hub page (provide link).</p>

            <section>
                <H2 class="sectionHeader">Information Systems in the Wild</H2>
                <p class="informationParagraph">My final project that I would like to highlight would be a project that I haven't completed yet and that would be “Information Systems in the Wild”.
                     In this project we were tasked with finding a company and analyzing how covid 19 has affected their implementation of information systems and their business processes.</p>
                <p class="informationParagraph">At the moment my group hasn't made much progress on this project.
                     I will update this if anything changes but we have had a hard time starting it because one of our group members has fallen ill and will need ample time to recover.</p>
