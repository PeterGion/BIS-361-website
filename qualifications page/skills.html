                    I am currently a Junior and I'm not only pursuing my computer science degree but also two other minors These are Business information systems and Business analytics.
                    With this combination I have learned a lot about biz tech and how the technology works in general. Here is a highlight of all the different programs and programming
                    languages that I have experience with. Also Take a look at my <a href="../Portfolio page/Portfolio.html">portfolio page</a> as well to get a better understanding of what I have done.</p>

                         However, this is a very important part of Linux, and I would argue that it is the best thing you can have under your belt while using Linux.

                          to go with this leaning, but I believe that if you give me a chance to learn about it on your team you will not be disappointed.

                          believe that given the chance I would be able to learn SQL and become a better programmer.

                          malfunctions with this program over the year and I have found solutions to most of them and got it working again.

                          it I could become very fluent in the android API.
